# Time-Series-
We are using 3 different time series obtained from the M4 competition dataset. These time series originated from real-world businesses but were transformed to avoid any negative values and maintain the anonymity of the data used. The main objective is to explore the data to its best without going into the forecasting stage. 
Generally, the analysis involves plotting the time series, checking for various regular components such as trend, seasonality, and level shift, identifying irregular components such as the presence of any outlier, decomposing the time series to get more insights of the data, performing statistical testing to check for stationarity of the data, and lastly, conducting ACF & PACF analysis to find the most suitable models for forecasting.
